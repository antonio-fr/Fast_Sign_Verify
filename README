 Fast Sign Verify

Copyright (C) 2014  Antoine FERRON


This is a software for PC which is focused on ECDSA Bitcoin
signature. It can check or sign with a wallet.


 Install :
Needs Python 2.7 and WxPython > 2.8
Zip with binaries for windows are provided in Releases.


 Use:
For signing:
Enter a message and a private key (base58chk).
Signature will appear in "signature" field after clicking on "Sign".
You can copy in clipboard the signature alone or the full signature
with "Copy All". This will fill the clipboard with "PGP style" signature
that you can copy directly in your email, forum message, etc...

For checking:
Enter the message, a public key (base58chk) and a signature (base64).
You can also enter a full message "PGP like" in message field (no
need to fill Address nor Signature field.)
It automagically detects the format between these two:
1) Simple "Input.io" style
---- MESSAGE HEADER ----
message signed
is here
---- SIG HEADER ----
1AddressBitcoin
Signature=
---- END FOOTER ----

2) "Qt1.0" style, Multibit
---- MESSAGE HEADER ----
message signed
is here
---- SIG HEADER ----
Version: Info
Address: 1AddressBitcoin

Signature=
---- END FOOTER ----

If you have any other format, you have to enter in the dedicated fields.
For example when message is signed with Electrum or official client, most
of the time you have to enter in 3 fields (message, address and signature).  


 Future Improvements:
Determinstic signing
Private key import wizard (wallet.dat, DER, ...)
Signature export and import options (format, PKCS,...)
Private key, address, options saving
BTChip integration (signing with USB keycard)
